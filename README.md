# Airbnb-Style REST API 🏡

Welcome to the backend API for an Airbnb-style property rental platform. This project provides a robust and scalable foundation built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.

This is a **backend-only** application, designed to be consumed by any frontend client (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, or a mobile app) via its RESTful endpoints.

## ✨ Key Features

  * 🔐 **User Authentication**: Secure signup, login, logout, and password reset functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OTP verification.
  * 👤 **Profile Management**: Endpoints for users to view and update their profile information.
  * 🏡 **Listing Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for property listings, including image uploads.
  * ⭐️ **Rating System**: Users can rate and review properties.
  * 📅 **Booking System**: A complete booking workflow, allowing users to create and cancel reservations.
  * 🔍 **Advanced Search**: Flexible search and filtering for listings based on city, category, and other criteria.
  * 🖼️ **Image Uploads**: Seamless image handling with **Multer**, with optional cloud storage via **Cloudinary**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later recommended)
  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running, or a MongoDB Atlas connection string.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd back-end
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following configuration.

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=5000

    # MongoDB Connection
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>

    # JWT Authentication
    JWT_SECRET=<your_strong_jwt_secret>

    # Cloudinary (for image storage)
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_key>
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_cloudinary_api_secret>

    # Nodemailer (for OTP emails)
    EMAIL_USER=<your_email_address>
    EMAIL_PASS=<your_email_password_or_app_password>
    ```

### Running the Application

  * **Development Mode** (with automatic restarts using `nodemon`):

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

  * **Production Mode**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specified in `.env`). You can now test the endpoints using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
